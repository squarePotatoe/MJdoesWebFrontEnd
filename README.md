Wecome to MJdoesCode. A website that I've decided to build from scratch to improve upon my knowledge of basics and how other frameworks borrow and improve on them.
I've been using Laravel quite a bit prior, which takes care of most of the voes of basic PHP and so on, but leaves me yearning for deeper understanding.

THIS IS AN ONGOING PROJECT AND THE DOCUMENTATION WILL IMPROVE!

More concise and 'to the point' descriptions coming later...

Here's what I use:
- The basics: HTML, CSS, PHP, JS
- Bootstrap
And that's it for now. 

This is a project for me to get more comfortable with basic PHP, as I think it's just unbeatable and unlikely will be replaced any time soon.

All the backend is not included in the initial commit. Will consider doing so later, since it doesn't contain any information of the host.
All of the files here are comitted straigth from my PC, naturally.

As per part of the idea of adapting and using what others made the entirety of theme is Bootstrap templates
I just took what I needed apart and split them into reusable components as needed.
